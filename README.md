# Ultrasound and CBCT Co-Registration 
This project aims to spatially align Ultrasound images with CBCT scans and test Ultrasound's efficacy in providing additional bone density data for highly invasive dental procedures, aiding in pre-operative planning and surgery.

This project was implemented in MATLAB programming language.

## Project Investors
This project was assigned by Dr. Dennis Flanagan, DMD to provide a Proof of Concept for testing the added benefits of Ultrasound Imaging for invasive dental surgical operations and overall feasibility of this software design. Additional requirments were given as a group. My individual contributions comprise all the code and work done here.

## Software Applications
An .nnrd file of a CBCT scan was used for this project because it has great volume rendering and data preservation features, making visualization and analysis of each scan/stitch easier. Additionally the MUST Toolbox was used for Ultrasound development. Both applications can be found among the files.

As for the MATLAB implementation, you can view it in MATLAB directly or use the .html links to open in your web browser.

## Results
Spatially aligning a 2D Ultrasound with a 3D CBCT Slice was successful and can be performed in real time. Further optimization is required to enhance the real-time speed, while the feasibility of this process has been demonstrated conclusively. To validate existing literature and confirm the efficacy of Ultrasound in accurately imaging the deep medullary jawbone, an image dataset taken with higher frequency and power ultrasound is necessary.
